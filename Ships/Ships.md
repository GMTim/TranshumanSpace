## Building a Ship

### Aspects
All ships have a high concept, a trouble, and three other aspects.

### Size
All ships have a size that ranges on the Fate Ladder.

 - **+8:** Colossal Moon Size
 - **+7:** Many Large Cities Size
 - **+6:** Large City Size
 - **+5:** Small City Size
 - **+4:** Huge Dreadnaught Capital Size
 - **+3:** Large Fighter Carrier Size
 - **+2:** Small Capital Ship
 - **+1:** Small Crewed Ship
 - **0:** Fighter
 - **-1:** Escape Pod
 - **-2:** EVA Suite
 
### Skills
All ships have the following skills. Skills are how capable the ship is, but still require crew. If a crew’s skill is less then the ships skill, the crew gets a +1. If a ships skill is less then a crew’s skill they get a -1.

 - Power
 - Acceleration
 - Defense
 - Sensors
 - Comms
 - Processing

### Stunts and Refresh
All ships have 3 refresh, and free stunts equal to its size + 2. Refresh can be traded for stunts for a minimum of 1 refresh.
Stunts allow a ship to have special abilities outside of normal ship system, such as a cloaking field, or fighter bay.
All ships come with a power plant, a propulsion system, storage bay, defense system, life support system, communication suite, computer core, sensor suite. Life support may be in the form of living space, or as sleeve storage mixed with VR.

#### Weapon Systems
A weapon system on a ship is a stunt. When creating a weapon system determine the skill used by that would activate the weapon system. For example, a mass driver would probably use the ships Power skill to operate. While a point defense system would use Sensors.
Also a weapon system’s default target is other ships of the same size class. You can freely target a weapon system down to smaller ships, but for every class you go up, you’ll have to use another stunt slot. For example, a fighter with an anti-capital (+4) weapon would need to use 4 stunts, lowering its refresh to 1.
Weapon systems also require a zone rating. If a weapon is meant to be used in the same zone as the ship is in, then it’s 0. For every zone outside of its range you get a -2 modifier. So a missile system might be set for one zone away, so trying to use it in the same zone would get a -2 modifier.

#### Combat
When two ships engage in combat, use their size difference as a negative modifier to their rolls to interact. For example, a fighter (0) fighting a capital ship (+2) would both get a -2 to rolls.
If both ships had weapons system designed for the other class that would eliminate or reduce the modifier. A fighter has a missile system geared toward small crewed ships (+1), and the capital has an anti-fighter point defense system (0). So the fighter would only have a -1 modifier, and the capital would have no negative modifier.

### Stress
Ships have 3 stress plus its size. Ships also have a number of complications equal to their size. Minimum 1 stress, and 1 complication.
