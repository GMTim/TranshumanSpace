## Weapon Systems

### Probability Mine
Due to a highly unstable quantum probability drive used in these mines, they may appear anywhere within an adjacent zone. Using the ship’s Processing skill to calculate which mine would, when activated, appear in the vicinity of the target.

### Viral Signal Loader
AI created, this weapon system uploads a viral signal to a target ship by passing the code as background galactic radiation. Filled by most systems, this weapon tricks ships into infecting themselves. It uses the ship’s Comm skill, and needs to be transmitted within the same zone as the target.

### Anti-Matter Torpedo
A self propelled torpedo that utilizes a matter anti-matter reaction to cause massive damage. Due to the nature of the weapon, accurate positional information is key for it’s use, so it uses the ship’s Sensor skill. Also this weapon is very dangerous, and so it won’t arm itself until it’s one zone away.
